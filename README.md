# Paint_Canvas
This exercise helped with working with the canvas element. An exercise as a part of Javascript30 from WesBos. It helped understand canvas and ctx. The idea of it was to create a canvas that takes in mouse clicks and responds by creating "brush strokes" of different colors, sizes, and hues depending on the mouse clicks.
